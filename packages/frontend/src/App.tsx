/**
 * The comments below are for notes and should be removed as this app grows.
 *
 * Ideally, this app should have truly dynamic routes which react-router-v6 gives us.
 * However, Ionic's IonRouterOutlet does not support react-router-v6 yet.
 * As a result, I'm proposing a hybrid approach where we use react-router-v5 to handle routing
 * But leverage react's in-built features to handle the dynamicity. This would be done by using a unique key
 * to depose the route and switch to a new one. This is not ideal but it's a workaround for now.
 *
 * It is yet to be implemented.
